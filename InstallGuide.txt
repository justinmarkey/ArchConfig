Partitoning:
    Create:

    512Mb , flag boot/efi partition and make it is a seperate from Windows Boot MGMR to avoid corruption of the partiton.
    root , flag / and make it 40gb about to store system files.
    home , flag /home and make it the majority of the disk to allow for userspace files
    recovery/backup , should be also considered for backing up system files on update failures and to allow the sys to recover from bricking.
    swap , flag linux swap = 8gb if more than 8gb ram installed on system

    *If dual booting, check to make sure you can boot into grub from uefi and allow Windows Boot MGMR / Distro Selection from one menu*
